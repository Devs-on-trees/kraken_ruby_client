# Kraken Ruby Client

A Ruby API wrapper for the Kraken Bitcoin Exchange, written for Ruby 2.3+.

Emphasis on speed, simplicity, no meta-programming, and few dependencies.

- Kraken Ruby Client has only one runtime dependency:
The fast [Curb (CUrl-RuBy) gem](https://github.com/taf2/curb), which provides
Ruby bindings for [libcurl](https://github.com/curl/curl), a fully-featured
client-side URL transfer library written in C.

- Kraken Ruby Client does not use [Hashie](https://github.com/intridea/hashie),
to avoid the [pain and performance costs]
(http://www.schneems.com/2014/12/15/hashie-considered-harmful.html) of
[subclassing Hash]
(http://tenderlovemaking.com/2014/06/02/yagni-methods-are-killing-me.html).

- Kraken Ruby Client uses fast, straightforward Minitest for its test suite.

Currently developed with Ruby 2.4.0. Written for Ruby 2.3 and up.
