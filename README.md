# kraken_ruby_client
A Kraken Exchange API wrapper for Ruby 2.3+.

Emphasis on speed, simplicity, no meta-programming, and few dependencies.

- Uses the fast Curb gem (CUrl-RuBy, Ruby bindings for libcurl written in C) for
HTTP.

- Does not subclass hash via Hashie like other Kraken Ruby clients.

- Uses as few dependencies as possible.

- Written for Ruby 2.3 and up.
